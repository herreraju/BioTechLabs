         The purpose of this lab was to learn how to use micropipettets and electrophoresis, how electrophoresis separates DNA, and how genetic engineering can help treat genetic diseases.<br>
        <br>
        1. Genetic disease means is a problem in the genes that creates an abnormal condition in an organism. These can include cystic fibrosis and hemophilia.<br>
        <br>
        2. DNA is the instructions for the cell. It lives in the nucleus. It runs anti parallel to itself in a double helix. It is made of a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and phosphate groups. The bases form in pairs that give the actual instructions to the cell. DNA is replicated semi-conservatively. There are 4 base pairs, ATCG.<br>
        <br>
        3. It is necessary to use small quantities to be as precise with our measurements as possible, because we are working on a cellular level and we should try to test using as close to that measurement as possible.<br>
        <br>
        4. It is important to see the liquid leave or enter the pipette because it can tell you if you let in an air bubble or don't push all of the liquid out.<br>
        <br>
        5. Touching the pipette tip might leave your DNA or bacteria in the tip, resulting in skewed results.<br>
        <br>
        6. Before genetic engineering, missing proteins would have had to be donated.<br>
        <br>
        7. Gel electrophoresis is used whenever you need to compare the weight of DNA samples.<br>
        <br>
        8. We can get a small chunk of DNA and add add a trait there, where it will replicate.<br>
        <br>
        9. S3 contained a single sample because it had only one band after electrophoresis.<br>
        <br>
        10. The dyes have a negative charge because they move toward the positive charge at the end of the gel.<br>
        <br>
        11. Xylene Cyanole was the heaviest, then bromaphenol blue, then orange G, based on distance traveled through the gel, from shortest to longest.<br>
        <br>
        12. Pipettes are used to get exact, specific quantities. Electrophoresis allows us to determine the size and carge of each substance.<br>
        <br>
        13. Recombinant plasmids could be used to copy a gene from one person and give it to somebody who needs it.<br>
