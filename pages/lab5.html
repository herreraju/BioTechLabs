        The plasmid is a vector that carries DNA sequences between organisms. It is sucked up into the bacteria and replicates until the trait is shown by the bacteria.<br>
        <br>
        1. Using the same enzyme ensures that sticky ends will fit together.<br>
        <br>
        2. Arabinose is necessary in order to make the product encoded by the inserted gene.<br>
        <br>
        3. E. Coli membranes regulate the entrance and exit of substances in order to protect against harmful bacteria.<br>
        <br>
        4. Growing bacteria transformed in the presence of ampicillin only grows the bacteria with a resistance to the antibiotic.<br>
        <br>
        5. Bacterial cells containing pARA-R plasmid that are not given arabinose will grow, but not turn red.<br>
        <br>
        6. To sort bacteria, grow both samples on an agar plate with ampicillin and a control group with just LB. See which grows more. <br>
        <br>
        7. P+ actually has a plasmid while P- acts as a control group.<br>
        <br>
        8. Cells need to recover from heat shock in order to correct the weakening of the cell membrane.<br>
        <br>
        9. Cells are incubated at 37 C in order to recover from heat shock.<br>
        <br>
        10. We use aseptic technique to keep harmful bacteria contained and to protect against error in our data.<br>
        <br>
        11. Plasmid vectors have a cloning site, which is a place where the Gene insert goes, a promoter, which expresses the gene, origin of replication, which allows the plasmid to be replicated, and selectable markers, which allow the bacteria with plasmids to be located.<br>
        <br>
        12. The restriction enzyme is selected based on the Gene needed to be cut.<br>
        <br>
        13. Bacteria keep resistance genes because they increase the likelihood of survival, which makes bacteria harder to kill using antibiotics. <br>
        <br>
        14. Our results match the predicted results.<br>
        <br>
        15. The red colonies appeared only on the LB/amp/ara plate because the arabinose allowed the plasmid to make RFP.<br>
        <br>
        16. It is important to have multiple copies of a recombinant plasmid within a cell because it increases the likelihood of success.<br>
        <br>
        17. The RFP Gene turns into a chain of amino acids, which results in a red protein.<br>
        <br>
        18. Bacteria can use a foreign gene by cutting a section of the foreign gene using restriction enzymes and basically gluing it into itself.<br>
