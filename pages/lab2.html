        In this lab, we digested the DNA. We used restriction enzymes to cut up the DNA.<br>
        <br>
        1. DNA is the instructions for the cell. It lives in the nucleus. It runs anti parallel to itself in a double helix. It is made of a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and phosphate groups. The bases form in pairs that give the actual instructions to the cell. DNA is replicated semi-conservatively. There are 4 base pairs, ATCG.<br>
        <br>
        2. DNA will always be in a double helix and have the same nucleotide structure. The order of the base pairs and size of the DNA will vary.<br>
        <br>
        3. Bacterial cells can make human genes because the cell will operate according to the DNA, not the cell-type.<br>
        <br>
        4. Restriction enzymes cut the DNA into pieces with sticky ends. Plasmids are small circles of bacterial DNA used to carry the foreign gene into the bacteria.<br>
        <br>
        5. A plasmid might give it's host an immunity to a common bacteria-killer by coding for it near the promoter and replicating this change.<br>
        <br>
        6. The host DNA does not have the sequences that the Restriction Enzymes will cut.<br>
        <br>
        7. The sticky end for BamHI is GATC. The sticky end for HindIII is AGCT.<br>
        <br>
        8. *Drawing* you would use EcoRi to cut the plant DNA so it can be easily inserted into the plasmid.<br>
        <br>
        9. It is important that the same enzyme is used to cut the the plasmid and insulin gene so that the insulin gene can be inserted at a similar point to where it was originally.<br>
        <br>
        10. I chose EcoRI because it cut the DNA at exactly the parts around the insulin gene without cutting the promoter.<br>
        <br>
        11. You would insert the gene next to the promoter because it initiates transcription.<br>
        <br>
        12. If the recombinant DNA was taken in, I would use ampicillin.<br>
        <br>
        13. Using two different enzymes to cut the plasmids prevents the plasmid from reforming a circle because the sticky ends aren't complimentary.<br>
        <br>
        14. If pKAN-R is digested with BamHI and HindIII, the following is produced:<br>
        -There is a 807bp strand that includes rfp and pBAD<br>
        -There is a 4,705bp strand that includes kanR<br>
        If pARA is digested with BamHI and HindIII, the following is produced:<br>
        -There is a 377bp strand <br>
        -There is a 4,495bp strand that includes ari, ampR, and araC<br>
        <br>
        15. In a plasmid, you will need an arabinose activator, origin site, and promoter sequence.<br>
        <br>
        16. A selectable marker is critical in cloning a gene in bacteria because it highlights the DNA fragment.<br>
        <br>
        17. The enzymes work best at 37 C degrees because it is the same as the human body's normal temperature. They should then be frozen in order to stop the incubation.<br>
        <br>
        18. A plasmid vector needs an origin, where transcription will occur, antibiotic site, to give it resistance against antibiotics, and a promoter, where the DNA polymerase can attach.<br>
        <br>
        19. In nature, restriction enzymes cut up harmful foreign DNA.<br>
        <br>
        20. Bacteria could keep an antibiotic resistance gene in order to keep itself from dying in certain conditions. This affects medicine today because, the more bacteria gets these resistances, the less harmful bacteria you can kill with antibiotics.<br>
        <br>
        21. Traits can cross species by inserting a gene into a vector and having the new species absorb it.<br>
